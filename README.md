# LantekCodingChallenge

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev) with angular 17 (https://angular.dev).

## Project structure

The project is structured as a monorepo, with the following structure:

![Project dependency graph. Nx Graph](https://github.com/joalopezmo/nx-monorepo/blob/master/apps/host/src/assets/graph.png)

- apps: contains the different applications of the project
- shared: contains the different libraries of the project

The project is an application of microfrontend architecture, so it is composed by different applications that are independent and can be deployed independently. The applications are:

- host: is the main application of the project, a recipe application that allows to manage the remotes microfront of the project.

### Apps

- nx-monorepo: contains the main application of the project, which is a web application that allows to manage the information giving by the lantek API. It is developed using angular 17 and angular material 17.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve nx-monorepo`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
